# Javascript DOM

fisrt let me tell you a web page consist of 3 things:

- webcontent 
- web layout (designing)
- behavior and functionalities

The webpage is made up of three languages:

  1. **HTML** to define the content of web pages

   2. **CSS** to specify the layout of web pages

   3. **JavaScript** to program the behavior of web pages

here we will learn about JavaScript

**JavaScript**, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

javascript does not use data type to declar variable.

There are three ways of declaring variables in js:

- **var** = global
- **let** = works only in specific block
- **const** = can't be change once declared

funtion in js is declared by using keyword **function**

```js
function fun()
{
    // your code
}
```

and funtion can return any type.
